# Hands---ON-ML-scikit-and-Pytorch-
This is a repository with code examples and projects from the book, Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn,   Keras &amp; TensorFlow, but, given these technologies are getting outdated and PyTorch becoming the norm,  I have written the code for these projects using PyTorch, for a smoother and more relevant experience!!
